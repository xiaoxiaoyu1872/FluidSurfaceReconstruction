## **About**
RXMesh is a surface triangle mesh data structure and programming model for processing static meshes on the GPU. RXMesh aims at provides a high-performance, generic, and compact data structure that can handle meshes regardless of their quality (e.g., non-manifold). The programming model helps to hide the complexity of the data structure and provides an intuitive access model for different use cases. For more details, please check out our paper:

*[RXMesh: A GPU Mesh Data Structure](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8r5848vp)*<br>

This repository provides 1) source code to reproduce the results presented in the paper (git tag [`v0.1.0`](https://github.com/owensgroup/RXMesh/tree/v0.1.0)) and 2) ongoing development of RXMesh. For 1), all input models used in the paper can be found [here](https://ucdavis365-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ahmahmoud_ucdavis_edu/En-vEpIdSGBHqvCIa-MVXRQBg5g7GfM3P3RwZBHL4Hby3w?e=2EVnJd). Models were collected from [Thingi10K](https://ten-thousand-models.appspot.com/) and [Smithsonian 3D](https://3d.si.edu/explore) repository. 

## **A Quick Glance**
RXMesh is a CUDA/C++ header-only library. All unit tests are under `tests/` folder. This includes the unit test for some basic functionalities along with the unit test for the query operations. All applications are under `apps/` folder.

## **Compilation**
The code can be compiled on Ubuntu (GCC 9) and Windows (Visual Studio 2019) providing that CUDA (>=11.1.0) is installed. To run the executable(s), an NVIDIA GPU should be installed on the machine.

### **Dependencies**
- [OpenMesh](https://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de:9000/OpenMesh/OpenMesh) to verify the applications against reference CPU implementation
- [RapidJson](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson) to report the results in JSON file(s)
- [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) for unit tests
- [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) for logging

All the dependencies are installed automatically! To compile the code:

```
> git clone https://github.com/owensgroup/RXMesh.git
> cd RXMesh
> mkdir build 
> cd build 
> cmake ../
```
Depending on the system, this will generate either a `.sln` project on Windows or a `make` file for a Linux system.

## **Replicability**
This repo was awarded the [replicability stamp](http://www.replicabilitystamp.org#https-github-com-owensgroup-rxmesh) by the Graphics Replicability Stamp Initiative (GRSI).

The scripts used to generate the data shown in the paper can be found under
* [Figure 6](https://github.com/owensgroup/RXMesh/blob/main/tests/RXMesh_test/benchmark.sh)
* [Figure 8 (a)](https://github.com/owensgroup/RXMesh/blob/main/apps/MCF/benchmark.sh)
* [Figure 8 (b)](https://github.com/owensgroup/RXMesh/blob/main/apps/Geodesic/benchmark.sh)
* [Figure 8 (c)](https://github.com/owensgroup/RXMesh/blob/main/apps/Filtering/benchmark.sh)
* [Figure 8 (d)](https://github.com/owensgroup/RXMesh/blob/main/apps/VertexNormal/benchmark.sh)

Each script should be run from the script's containing directory after compiling the code in `build/` directory. The only input parameter needed is the path to the input OBJ files. The resulting JSON files will be written to `output/` directory.
