# FluidSurfaceReconstruction
This is the source code of paper <<Enhanced narrow band surface reconstruction with anisotropic kernel>>
The program is based on C/C++ and CUDA 9.0 or newer. 
Operating environment: Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS or newer.
I have included all the other external libraries or header files need already, so no additional configuration is required.
